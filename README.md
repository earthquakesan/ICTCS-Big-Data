# ICTCS'2017: Lowering the Barriers to Big Data Solutions

"Lowering the Barriers to Big Data Solutions" workshop will present the results achieved throughout the BigDataEurope (BDE) project, which is the part of the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research Europe flag and innovation program. The workshop will concentrate on the practical aspects of developing and maintaining Big Data applications. The applications will be deployed on the Big Data Integrator platform, a modular platform for deploying Big Data applications, which is developed in the BDE project. The workshop will cover the theory behind Big Data applications and will provide the explanation of the key decisions for the Big Data Integrator platform architecture. Each theorethical part will be followed by a hands-on session. The participants will be invited to accomplish assignments, which will teach them how to solve Big Data problems using Spark and BDI platform.
