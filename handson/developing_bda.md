# Developing Big Data applications

This hands-on session will require a Scala IDE (I personally prefer IntelliJ Idea).

# Importing example project
Import [Twitter Trends](https://github.com/earthquakesan/TwitterTrends) sbt project into your preferable IDE.
IntelliJ Idea can import git repositories as projects.
You can also just clone it to your workspace and run from command line:
```
git clone git@github.com:earthquakesan/TwitterTrends.git
```

# Assignments
